A React app that provides a light-weight interface for the mechanics of the [Splendor board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splendor_(game)).

This app uses Apollo Client and talks to [this simple GraphQL server](https://github.com/daniman/splendor-server) for its game mechanics and state persistence.

To run the app:
```
npm install
npm start
```
